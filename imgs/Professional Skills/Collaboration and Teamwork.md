# To-Do:Working through Conflict (Project: Draft a Message to Resolve Conflict)

***Working through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues***

In your work learning to code—and in your future job as a programmer—you will have times when conflict comes up. Conflict is a normal part of working with people. Being a good partner, team member and employee involves learning how to work through conflict in the best way possible. When you take leadership on working through conflict in a positive way, you resolve issues early and build trust with people, making it easier to do good work together moving forward.



Since Microverse is intended to look like real work, with teamwork and daily accountability to ensure progress, you can expect conflict like a real workplace. We see conflict as a normal part of working together, and want to help you learn tools for handling in positive ways.



Task #1: Your Experience with Conflict
Think about your work at Microverse so far, especially your work with your coding partner, TSEs and others. You can also think about past coworkers or study partners. 



List at least 5 conflicts you've experienced at Microverse or elsewhere. If it's helpful, ask yourself the following questions:



What happened?
Why was it hard? What was frustrating to you about it?
What, if anything, did you do to fix the problem?
How do you feel about it now?


Keep your list of conflicts and any notes you've made about them so you can refer to them later in this lesson.


Task #2: Conflict Reading
Now, with the problems you’ve faced in mind, read the following 3 articles about working through conflict on teams:

https://hbr.org/2019/05/what-to-do-after-an-uncomfortable-conversation-with-a-coworker


As these articles make clear, conflict is a normal part of working with others, and resolving it takes practice. Don’t worry if it feels hard every time — that’s normal! Like other teamwork skills, resolving conflict well takes effort and time. Most seasoned professionals are still working on getting better at it!



As you think about conflict in your Microverse culture—or in a future, global coding job—don’t forget to consider that how people respond to conflict may be different across cultures. Different cultures perceive conflict differently, and have different ways they learn to resolve it. Keep this in mind as you think through how to work through conflict at Microverse as well as with partners in other cultures once you become a remote software developer. For example, you might ask the following questions of the person you are working with:



* What is conflict like in your culture? 
* Do people usually face conflict or avoid it?
* How do people in your culture prefer to resolve conflict?


You can save these questions for future reference. They may be useful for times you and your coding partner disagree, or a time when you have another conflict.
