# To-Do:Working through Conflict (Project: Draft a Message to Resolve Conflict)

***Working through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues***

In your work learning to code—and in your future job as a programmer—you will have times when conflict comes up. Conflict is a normal part of working with people. Being a good partner, team member and employee involves learning how to work through conflict in the best way possible. When you take leadership on working through conflict in a positive way, you resolve issues early and build trust with people, making it easier to do good work together moving forward.



Since Microverse is intended to look like real work, with teamwork and daily accountability to ensure progress, you can expect conflict like a real workplace. We see conflict as a normal part of working together, and want to help you learn tools for handling in positive ways.



Task #1: Your Experience with Conflict
Think about your work at Microverse so far, especially your work with your coding partner, TSEs and others. You can also think about past coworkers or study partners. 



List at least 5 conflicts you've experienced at Microverse or elsewhere. If it's helpful, ask yourself the following questions:



What happened?
Why was it hard? What was frustrating to you about it?
What, if anything, did you do to fix the problem?
How do you feel about it now?


Keep your list of conflicts and any notes you've made about them so you can refer to them later in this lesson.
