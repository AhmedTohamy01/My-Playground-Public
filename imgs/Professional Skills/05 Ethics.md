# To-Do:Integrity is Forever: Ethics of Work (Project: Ethics Profile)

***The Ethics of Work in and Beyond Microverse***

Many parts of ethics in the workplace are universal: Be honest. Be reliable. Don’t cheat. Don’t take credit for work done by others. These are values most people learn at a young age, and they hold true across professions. 

However, with the Internet making access to information and content easier than ever, cheating is also easier than ever, especially for some professions. At Microverse this would mean finding the code for assignments somewhere online, and submitting it as your own. In a writing profession, this would mean publishing whole sections from published papers or books as your own without giving credit to the original author. 

The point of Microverse is to learn coding languages and be able to take on new problems in future jobs using code. This is not possible unless you put in the time and make the effort to learn, day-by-day. In this lesson, we consider why honesty is important, why it can be hard to be honest at times, and how the ethics of working honestly and gaining colleagues' trust include not only telling the truth, but making an effort daily to develop a strong worth ethic. 


***Why is honesty important?***

Michael Josephson, a wise expert on ethics in the workplace, once said that "honesty doesn't always pay, but dishonesty always costs.” What did he mean? Being the person working honestly may mean more effort, it may mean things take longer or cost more. When things are really difficult—as a student, in the workplace—cheating can feel like an easy way to get to the end goal faster. But as Josephson says, it always has a cost. It will leave you not understanding the content fully as a student. It could get you fired from a job if discovered in the workplace, or worse if the dishonesty extends to something illegal.


*Task #1. Why does honesty in the workplace matter?*

It may seem obvious to say honesty is important. Of course we shouldn't cheat! But when it comes to the day-to-day of working it can feel less clear. There might be difficult moments where you don't know what you're doing. There may be tempting opportunities to cut corners or cheat that don't seem like they would hurt anyone. Especially when people are new to something, they may feel overwhelmed and decide cheating feels easier. Watch the following two videos to learn more about different perspectives on why honesty in the workplace is important, and how it can be difficult at times.

After watching the videos, spend a few minutes reflecting on what you learned and answering the following questions. Keep your notes somewhere you can refer to them for the final assignment.

* Why do people do dishonest things at work?
* What makes honesty powerful?
* What might motivate you to be dishonest at work?


***How to Develop a Strong Work Ethic***

For companies, it's important to have employees who follow company policies, do what they say they'll do, and behave honestly in their jobs. For individuals, it's important to be able to trust colleagues will show up and follow through on what is expected of them as best as possible. Being someone who is reliable and trustworthy in these ways is about having a strong work ethic.

How are honesty and work ethic related? Honesty is needed to build trust, and the reasons people choose dishonesty can be avoided by having a strong work ethic. What does it mean to have a strong work ethic? How do you develop one?
