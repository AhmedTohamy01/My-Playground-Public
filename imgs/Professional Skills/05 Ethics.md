# To-Do:Integrity is Forever: Ethics of Work (Project: Ethics Profile)

***The Ethics of Work in and Beyond Microverse***

Many parts of ethics in the workplace are universal: Be honest. Be reliable. Don’t cheat. Don’t take credit for work done by others. These are values most people learn at a young age, and they hold true across professions. 

However, with the Internet making access to information and content easier than ever, cheating is also easier than ever, especially for some professions. At Microverse this would mean finding the code for assignments somewhere online, and submitting it as your own. In a writing profession, this would mean publishing whole sections from published papers or books as your own without giving credit to the original author. 

The point of Microverse is to learn coding languages and be able to take on new problems in future jobs using code. This is not possible unless you put in the time and make the effort to learn, day-by-day. In this lesson, we consider why honesty is important, why it can be hard to be honest at times, and how the ethics of working honestly and gaining colleagues' trust include not only telling the truth, but making an effort daily to develop a strong worth ethic. 


***Why is honesty important?***

Michael Josephson, a wise expert on ethics in the workplace, once said that "honesty doesn't always pay, but dishonesty always costs.” What did he mean? Being the person working honestly may mean more effort, it may mean things take longer or cost more. When things are really difficult—as a student, in the workplace—cheating can feel like an easy way to get to the end goal faster. But as Josephson says, it always has a cost. It will leave you not understanding the content fully as a student. It could get you fired from a job if discovered in the workplace, or worse if the dishonesty extends to something illegal.


*Task #1. Why does honesty in the workplace matter?*

It may seem obvious to say honesty is important. Of course we shouldn't cheat! But when it comes to the day-to-day of working it can feel less clear. There might be difficult moments where you don't know what you're doing. There may be tempting opportunities to cut corners or cheat that don't seem like they would hurt anyone. Especially when people are new to something, they may feel overwhelmed and decide cheating feels easier. Watch the following two videos to learn more about different perspectives on why honesty in the workplace is important, and how it can be difficult at times.

After watching the videos, spend a few minutes reflecting on what you learned and answering the following questions. Keep your notes somewhere you can refer to them for the final assignment.

* Why do people do dishonest things at work?
* What makes honesty powerful?
* What might motivate you to be dishonest at work?


***How to Develop a Strong Work Ethic***

For companies, it's important to have employees who follow company policies, do what they say they'll do, and behave honestly in their jobs. For individuals, it's important to be able to trust colleagues will show up and follow through on what is expected of them as best as possible. Being someone who is reliable and trustworthy in these ways is about having a strong work ethic.

How are honesty and work ethic related? Honesty is needed to build trust, and the reasons people choose dishonesty can be avoided by having a strong work ethic. What does it mean to have a strong work ethic? How do you develop one?

*Task #2: How to develop a good work ethic?*

Read/watch the following perspectives on what it means to have a good work ethic, and how you can work on improving yours.

***Assignment: Ethics Profile***

In this lesson we have mostly considered ideas around honesty in general, and honesty while studying to be a software developer. But honesty in the workplace is universal. All professions have ethics and definitions of what it means to have a good work ethic. For this assignment, you will interview someone someone in your life about ethics in their profession, and write a brief profile based on the conversation. 

Who to Interview: You can interview anyone! If you know someone who already works as a software engineer, this would be especially valuable, but any profession will do. What's important is that it be someone you respect, preferably with at least 5-10 years work experience (more years is better!). Ideas include:

* A family member (parents, grandparents, siblings, an aunt or uncle)
* A community member
* Someone you know from school or work


What to ask: Write 5-10 questions to ask this person. We provide you with some ideas for questions to get you started, but feel free to ask them anything you like related to honesty and work ethics in their profession.

* What does honesty mean in your profession? 
* What does it mean to have a strong work ethic?
* Have you ever done anything dishonest at work? 
* Do you know anyone else who has ever done something dishonest? What happened and how did people find out?


How to capture the conversation: Once you have your questions, have a 15-20 minute conversation with this person, using the questions as a guide. Make sure you record it somehow, for example through a voice recording, video recording, or by taking notes. Make sure to ask for permission if you are voice or video recording your conversation! (It's illegal to record someone without consent!)

Writing your ethics profile: The final task in this lesson is to write a short (200 word) essay about the person you interviewed. What did you learn? How does it connect to what you learned in this lesson? Make sure that your profile:

* Is at least 200 words 
* Describes the person you interviewed with relevant details (e.g., age, years of work experience, profession, position, education, location, relationship to you)
* Connects to material from this lesson (remember you have your notes from earlier in the lesson)
* Uses direct quotes from the person you interviewed

As always, use best practices for checking your writing and making improvements before submitting:

* Check grammar using Grammarly or a similar tool
* Ask your coding partner, mentor or another friend to read and give you feedback if you can
* For this assignment you can also show the person you interviewed (if they speak English) and get their feedback as well!
