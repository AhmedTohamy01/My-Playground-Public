# To-Do:Working through Conflict (Project: Draft a Message to Resolve Conflict)

***Working through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues***

In your work learning to code—and in your future job as a programmer—you will have times when conflict comes up. Conflict is a normal part of working with people. Being a good partner, team member and employee involves learning how to work through conflict in the best way possible. When you take leadership on working through conflict in a positive way, you resolve issues early and build trust with people, making it easier to do good work together moving forward.



Since Microverse is intended to look like real work, with teamwork and daily accountability to ensure progress, you can expect conflict like a real workplace. We see conflict as a normal part of working together, and want to help you learn tools for handling in positive ways.



Task #1: Your Experience with Conflict
Think about your work at Microverse so far, especially your work with your coding partner, TSEs and others. You can also think about past coworkers or study partners. 



List at least 5 conflicts you've experienced at Microverse or elsewhere. If it's helpful, ask yourself the following questions:



What happened?
Why was it hard? What was frustrating to you about it?
What, if anything, did you do to fix the problem?
How do you feel about it now?


Keep your list of conflicts and any notes you've made about them so you can refer to them later in this lesson.


Task #2: Conflict Reading
Now, with the problems you’ve faced in mind, read the following 3 articles about working through conflict on teams:

https://www.bustle.com/articles/103025-8-ways-to-handle-a-conflict-with-a-coworker

https://hbr.org/2019/05/what-to-do-after-an-uncomfortable-conversation-with-a-coworker


As these articles make clear, conflict is a normal part of working with others, and resolving it takes practice. Don’t worry if it feels hard every time — that’s normal! Like other teamwork skills, resolving conflict well takes effort and time. Most seasoned professionals are still working on getting better at it!



As you think about conflict in your Microverse culture—or in a future, global coding job—don’t forget to consider that how people respond to conflict may be different across cultures. Different cultures perceive conflict differently, and have different ways they learn to resolve it. Keep this in mind as you think through how to work through conflict at Microverse as well as with partners in other cultures once you become a remote software developer. For example, you might ask the following questions of the person you are working with:



* What is conflict like in your culture? 
* Do people usually face conflict or avoid it?
* How do people in your culture prefer to resolve conflict?


You can save these questions for future reference. They may be useful for times you and your coding partner disagree, or a time when you have another conflict.


***Assignment: Message to Resolve a Conflict***

To complete this lesson on conflict, choose 1 of the situations from the list you made in Task #1. Using the articles as reference for ideas, write a professional email to the person (your coding partner, TSE, staff at Microverse, or anyone else). Important: Don’t worry about perfection, and use a fake name if you prefer! The point here is to practice communicating about conflict. 


When you are done and have a draft message, look it over and ask yourself the following questions:


Did you describe the facts or what happened/is happening in a neutral way?
Did you state your feelings about it?
Did you ask for the other person’s perspective? 
Did you suggest a next step?
Is the tone positive?
Did you check to make sure writing is clear and free of grammatical errors? (You can use Grammarly or another similar tool, or ask a friend.)

Make any edits or changes to your writing so the message is as clear as possible.

Suggestion: If the situation is still an active conflict, you can use your message to communicate with the person involved. If the conflict is big, we suggest having a conversation about it over video as well. Remember, your Student Success team is always available to help you work through conflict as well.

# To-Do:How to Give Feedback (Project: Giving and Receiving Feedback)

***How to Give Positive and Constructive Feedback***
At Microverse, students work in pairs and teams to learn to code and this brings with it many opportunities to see how each other work up-close. There is great power in learning this way; it’s motivating and gives you access to smart peers every day who are on the same journey you are. But it can also come with difficulties when you find yourself not seeing eye to eye with your partner. Common challenges that come up with Microverse partners—and are similar to the kinds of challenges faced in teamwork at a real job—include:



* One person insisting there’s only one way to learn things or complete projects and not listening to the other’s opinions
* One partner getting too competitive or moving too quickly
* One person not showing up consistently or constantly getting distracted during work time 
* One person constantly interrupting and talking over their partner


Learning to work together and move past these kinds of challenges involves learning to communicate about what works and doesn’t work and finding ways to compromise or get help changing the situation when necessary. An important element of this communication is the ability to give and receive positive and constructive feedback.

***What is constructive feedback?***
Feedback is information about how another person is doing their work or communicating with others. It is a conversation in response to another’s actions. Feedback can be about praise, but it can also be about learning. Some people think of feedback as a gift, because it is an opportunity to learn about ourselves and get better. Positive, constructive feedback is:



* Kind
* Direct  
* Honest 
* Respectful
* Delivered in private


We are all a little afraid of constructive feedback. It can be uncomfortable. We may feel embarrassed, unsure of ourselves, or worse, like a failure. But good, constructive feedback helps us improve, and the more we can learn to give constructive feedback and learn from it when we receive it, the better we will be able to work with all kinds of people. 


Task #1: Learning about Good Feedback
To learn more about constructive feedback and begin connecting with your own experiences, read the following article, then watch at least two of the four videos referenced in the article. If you aren't sure which to choose, watch the first minute or two of each and then choose (or watch all four if you have time!).

While you watch, take notes and think about the following questions:

* What is good feedback according to the speaker?
* What do you agree with? 
* What do you disagree with?
* What else would you like to know?
