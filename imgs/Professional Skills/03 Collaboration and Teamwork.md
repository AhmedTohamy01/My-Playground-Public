***Working through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues***

In your work learning to code—and in your future job as a programmer—you will have times when conflict comes up. Conflict is a normal part of working with people. Being a good partner, team member and employee involves learning how to work through conflict in the best way possible. When you take leadership on working through conflict in a positive way, you resolve issues early and build trust with people, making it easier to do good work together moving forward.

Since Microverse is intended to look like real work, with teamwork and daily accountability to ensure progress, you can expect conflict like a real workplace. We see conflict as a normal part of working together, and want to help you learn tools for handling in positive ways.

Task #1: Your Experience with Conflict
Think about your work at Microverse so far, especially your work with your coding partner, TSEs and others. You can also think about past coworkers or study partners. 

List at least 5 conflicts you've experienced at Microverse or elsewhere. If it's helpful, ask yourself the following questions:


What happened?

Why was it hard? What was frustrating to you about it?
What, if anything, did you do to fix the problem?
How do you feel about it now?

Keep your list of conflicts and any notes you've made about them so you can refer to them later in this lesson.

Task #2: Conflict Reading
Now, with the problems you’ve faced in mind, read the following 3 articles about working through conflict on teams:

https://remote.co/work-through-conflict-on-remote-teams/

https://www.bustle.com/articles/103025-8-ways-to-handle-a-conflict-with-a-coworker

https://hbr.org/2019/05/what-to-do-after-an-uncomfortable-conversation-with-a-coworker


As these articles make clear, conflict is a normal part of working with others, and resolving it takes practice. Don’t worry if it feels hard every time — that’s normal! Like other teamwork skills, resolving conflict well takes effort and time. Most seasoned professionals are still working on getting better at it!

As you think about conflict in your Microverse culture—or in a future, global coding job—don’t forget to consider that how people respond to conflict may be different across cultures. Different cultures perceive conflict differently, and have different ways they learn to resolve it. Keep this in mind as you think through how to work through conflict at Microverse as well as with partners in other cultures once you become a remote software developer. For example, you might ask the following questions of the person you are working with:

* What is conflict like in your culture? 
* Do people usually face conflict or avoid it?
* How do people in your culture prefer to resolve conflict?

You can save these questions for future reference. They may be useful for times you and your coding partner disagree, or a time when you have another conflict.


***Assignment: Message to Resolve a Conflict***

To complete this lesson on conflict, choose 1 of the situations from the list you made in Task #1. Using the articles as reference for ideas, write a professional email to the person (your coding partner, TSE, staff at Microverse, or anyone else). Important: Don’t worry about perfection, and use a fake name if you prefer! The point here is to practice communicating about conflict. 

When you are done and have a draft message, look it over and ask yourself the following questions:

* Did you describe the facts or what happened/is happening in a neutral way?
* Did you state your feelings about it?
* Did you ask for the other person’s perspective? 
* Did you suggest a next step?
* Is the tone positive?
* Did you check to make sure writing is clear and free of grammatical errors? (You can use Grammarly or another similar tool, or ask a friend.)

Make any edits or changes to your writing so the message is as clear as possible.

Suggestion: If the situation is still an active conflict, you can use your message to communicate with the person involved. If the conflict is big, we suggest having a conversation about it over video as well. Remember, your Student Success team is always available to help you work through conflict as well.

# To-Do:How to Give Feedback (Project: Giving and Receiving Feedback)

***How to Give Positive and Constructive Feedback***

At Microverse, students work in pairs and teams to learn to code and this brings with it many opportunities to see how each other work up-close. There is great power in learning this way; it’s motivating and gives you access to smart peers every day who are on the same journey you are. But it can also come with difficulties when you find yourself not seeing eye to eye with your partner. Common challenges that come up with Microverse partners—and are similar to the kinds of challenges faced in teamwork at a real job—include:


* One person insisting there’s only one way to learn things or complete projects and not listening to the other’s opinions
* One partner getting too competitive or moving too quickly
* One person not showing up consistently or constantly getting distracted during work time 
* One person constantly interrupting and talking over their partner


Learning to work together and move past these kinds of challenges involves learning to communicate about what works and doesn’t work and finding ways to compromise or get help changing the situation when necessary. An important element of this communication is the ability to give and receive positive and constructive feedback.

***What is constructive feedback?***

Feedback is information about how another person is doing their work or communicating with others. It is a conversation in response to another’s actions. Feedback can be about praise, but it can also be about learning. Some people think of feedback as a gift, because it is an opportunity to learn about ourselves and get better. Positive, constructive feedback is:

* Kind
* Direct  
* Honest 
* Respectful
* Delivered in private

We are all a little afraid of constructive feedback. It can be uncomfortable. We may feel embarrassed, unsure of ourselves, or worse, like a failure. But good, constructive feedback helps us improve, and the more we can learn to give constructive feedback and learn from it when we receive it, the better we will be able to work with all kinds of people. 

Task #1: Learning about Good Feedback
To learn more about constructive feedback and begin connecting with your own experiences, read the following article, then watch at least two of the four videos referenced in the article. If you aren't sure which to choose, watch the first minute or two of each and then choose (or watch all four if you have time!). 

https://www.inc.com/joe-hirsch/4-ted-talks-from-women-that-will-change-your-relationship-with-feedback.html

While you watch, take notes and think about the following questions:

* What is good feedback according to the speaker?
* What do you agree with? 
* What do you disagree with?
* What else would you like to know?

Task#2: Learning about receiving Feedback

The second step is to learn how to receive feedback. Just like it is difficulties to give feedback, it can also be difficult to receive it. We generally do not like it when people give us feedback so there are a few steps that you can follow to make sure you learn something from the feedback that is given to you. 

Step 1: Listen. Don’t reply automatically or justify yourself.

Our first reaction with criticism or feedback is often to disapprove or defend ourselves. No matter how many times we get feedback: it will always hurt at first. Take at least one second before responding and remind yourself to be calm.

Step 2: Be open. No feedback, no improvement.

Feedback gives you the opportunity to improve your skills, your relationships and yourself. You should always approach feedback in a sincere and beneficial manner so that you can learn and grow from it. Keep in mind that it was probably very uncomfortable for this person to step up and give you feedback. Analyze how you can grow from this piece of information. Keep in mind that the person who is giving you feedback might not be very good at doing it, so the message might sound harsher than intended. Don't just reject the feedback because the message was not brought to you well -- there is always something you can learn.

Step 3: Ask follow up questions to understand the feedback better.

Try to actively listen. https://www.thebalancecareers.com/want-to-become-a-better-listener-1918650
Ask questions with curiosity. Try to avoid sounding judgemental and have an open attitude.

Example questions:

Can you say more about what you mean when you say...?
Can you be more specific about what it means to you, and what your expectations are?
Can you give specific examples of times when I was / wasn’t...?
What does it look like to you?
Can you give examples or suggestions of what you think I can do differently to be more...?

Step 4: Keep in mind that feedback is subjective! It’s always how the other sees you through their lens.

As we said before, there is always something to learn from a piece of feedback. But that doesn't mean that you have to agree with 100% of the feedback that the person gave. Everyone has their own interpretation of a situation so it can also mean that they are missing some information.

For example:

If your manager tells you that they feel like you are not motivated because you have been not as productive. It can be that that week someone in your family is very sick that requires your attention.

Your manager doesn't know that, so you can explain that there was something requiring some of your attention, but that going forward you will communicate better what is happening in your life if it impacts your work.

Step 5: Make sure to distinguish between constructive and destructive feedback.

Constructive feedback is when someone gives you feedback with the goal of improving your behavior. Destructive feedback is when someone gives you feedback with the goal of bringing you down and hurting you as a person.

Step 6: Thank the giver for their feedback!

Feedback can save you from possible pitfalls down the road. This person just invested in you by providing you with feedback so remember to thank them!

Assignment: Practicing Giving Positive and Constructive Feedback
Read the following scenarios, which come from real Microverse students. 


Scenario 1:  Partner Misses Meetings without Communicating. Sergio is your coding partner. He has missed multiple meetings without any communication beforehand. The reasons are always good reasons for missing, and you understand once he explains, but you are starting to feel like you can't rely on him to show up. You are thinking of letting Student Success know, but first want to give him some feedback to see if he changes his actions.


Scenario 2: Partner Rushes and is Overconfident. Lindon had some experience with coding prior to Microverse, and is very confident in his abilities. At first, you learn a lot from him, but with time find that he rushes through the curriculum too quickly. Lately, you notice this is affecting both of your learning because he doesn't dedicate the time needed to learn new things but then thinks he knows more than you because he started out ahead. Give Lindon some feedback about his learning style and how it's impacting your work together. 


Now think about how to give Sergio and Lindon positive and constructive feedback. What should they do differently? How can you tell them so, following the best practices for giving constructive feedback? Gather your ideas using the best practices for providing feedback described in the article and videos above. Also be sure to:

* Think about how to be honest, kind, direct and respectful
* Describe how the behavior is impacting you/your work
* Suggest changes or steps needed
* Invite follow up or continued conversation


Once you have prepared your feedback, record a video of yourself delivering the feedback to Sergio and Lindon in a constructive way. Spend about 1-2 minutes giving feedback to each person. Please record your feedback to both people in one video.

When you have completed your 2-4 minute video, post it to a video-sharing site such as YouTube, and submit the link using the form below.

Optional: Share your video with your coding partner and ask to watch their video. Then give each other suggestions for improvement and talk about your own preferences for giving and receiving feedback.
