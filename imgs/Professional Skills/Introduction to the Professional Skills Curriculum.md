Introduction to the Professional Skills Curriculum
Many companies have budgets for employees to do job development training or professional development (PD) in an ongoing way. Many also have periodic sessions where employees have the chance to get better at giving and receiving feedback, or managing their time, or other soft skills. The Microverse Professional Skills Curriculum is designed to feel like real PD that would happen in a real job. The sessions help you prepare materials you will need to apply for jobs and gain skills that will make you successful in the workplace. Through readings, videos, projects and ongoing practice, you will:

* Build strong communication skills
* Create a portfolio to use when applying for jobs
