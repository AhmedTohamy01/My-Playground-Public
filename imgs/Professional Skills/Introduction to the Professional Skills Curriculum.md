***Introduction to the Professional Skills Curriculum***
Many companies have budgets for employees to do job development training or professional development (PD) in an ongoing way. Many also have periodic sessions where employees have the chance to get better at giving and receiving feedback, or managing their time, or other soft skills. The Microverse Professional Skills Curriculum is designed to feel like real PD that would happen in a real job. The sessions help you prepare materials you will need to apply for jobs and gain skills that will make you successful in the workplace. Through readings, videos, projects and ongoing practice, you will:

* Build strong communication skills
* Create a portfolio to use when applying for jobs
* Learn problem-solving, conflict management, and other key workplace skills
* Gain confidence in yourself as a learner and colleague
* Learn about cultural differences in the workplace and the expectations of global tech companies
* Get better at networking
* Have the chance to work on writing 
* And much, much more 

***Professional Skills Curriculum Topics***
The lessons included in the Professional Skills Curriculum are designed with Microverse students in mind. Many come straight from problems that have arisen for students, questions they have had, and specific needs they have at the job application stage. To ensure the solo curriculum meets the needs of students, new content is added when needed.

A sampling of current lessons in the Professional Skills Curriculum includes:

* Working Through Conflict with Coding Partners, TSEs and Future Colleagues
* How to Give Positive and Constructive Feedback
* How to Look Professional Online
* Freelancing Simulations

We suggest you start at the beginning and work through the lessons in order. However, if you find yourself needing support on a particular skill (such as working through conflict) you can jump to this lesson first. The Freelancing Simulations must be completed in order.

***The Professional Skills Curriculum and Career Prep***
Although the Professional Skills Curriculum helps you get ready for your future job, it is important to understand that it is not Career Prep. The Career Prep Curriculum is a separate set of activities specifically designed to support you during the time you are preparing to apply for jobs, interviewing, and negotiating offers. You will move on to that curriculum after you have completed the Technical Curriculum, this Professional Skills Curriculum, and your coding challenges.
