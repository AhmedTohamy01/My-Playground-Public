***Introduction to the Professional Skills Curriculum***
Many companies have budgets for employees to do job development training or professional development (PD) in an ongoing way. Many also have periodic sessions where employees have the chance to get better at giving and receiving feedback, or managing their time, or other soft skills. The Microverse Professional Skills Curriculum is designed to feel like real PD that would happen in a real job. The sessions help you prepare materials you will need to apply for jobs and gain skills that will make you successful in the workplace. Through readings, videos, projects and ongoing practice, you will:

* Build strong communication skills
* Create a portfolio to use when applying for jobs
* Learn problem-solving, conflict management, and other key workplace skills
* Gain confidence in yourself as a learner and colleague
* Learn about cultural differences in the workplace and the expectations of global tech companies
* Get better at networking
* Have the chance to work on writing 
* And much, much more 

***Professional Skills Curriculum Topics***
The lessons included in the Professional Skills Curriculum are designed with Microverse students in mind. Many come straight from problems that have arisen for students, questions they have had, and specific needs they have at the job application stage. To ensure the solo curriculum meets the needs of students, new content is added when needed.

A sampling of current lessons in the Professional Skills Curriculum includes:
