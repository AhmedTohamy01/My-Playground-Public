# To-Do:Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice (Project: Soft Skills Assessment)

***Why Soft Skills Matter***
As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.

In general, soft skills are attitudes and habits that shape how you work, alone and on teams. Soft skills help you develop strong relationships with coworkers and contribute to a positive work culture. Examples of soft skills valued by employers:

* Teamwork
* Integrity
* Good communication skills
* Reliability
* Organization


At Microverse, we are working every day to build an excellent technical learning experience, but coding languages are not enough; we want you to finish Microverse with excellent soft skills as well. 


***Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice***
As you work through the Professional Skills Curriculum lessons, remember that soft skills get better with awareness and practice. No matter what stage of our career, we all have areas we can improve on. Perhaps you are a good communicator, but struggle with time management. Maybe you are the most punctual person ever, but have a hard time speaking your opinions. With each lesson in the Professional Skills Curriculum, we will help you learn about your strengths and areas of weakness and give you lots of chances to practice and improve.

Task #1: Soft Skills Reading
To begin thinking about where you are strongest and where you can improve your soft skills, read the following articles:

* The Skill You Probably Need to Brush up on for your Engineering Career 
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/engineering-soft-skills-teamwork-collaboration

* How to Develop and Train for Soft Skills in the Workplace (you can also listen to this article read out loud as you read - great for working on English at the same time!): 
https://elearningindustry.com/soft-skills-in-the-workplace-develop-train


Task #2: Reflection
Now, thinking about what you just read, spend 3-5 minutes reflecting on your own soft skills: 

* What are your strongest soft skills? 
* Where do you think you need to improve your soft skills? 
* What is most difficult for you when working with others in class or at work?

Jot your ideas down somewhere; you will use them for the assignment at the end of this lesson.


***What are your strengths and weaknesses?***

An important step to begin improving soft skills is to be comfortable looking at our own strengths and weaknesses. Self awareness and understanding are essential for learning to work better with others. As an exercise in understanding yourself better, please complete The 16 Personalities Test: 

  

* Link to the 16 Personalities Test
https://www.16personalities.com/

* Expect to spend about 10 minutes answering the questions
* If English is your second language, we suggest having a page open to a dictionary or translation page in  case there are words you don't know.
* When you are finished:
  - Please take a screenshot of the results page showing what type of personality you are or email yourself the results
  - Follow the "Start Reading" link
  - Look at the "Explore Your Type" menu on the left of the page and find "Strengths and Weaknesses"
  - Read about the strengths and weaknesses of your personality type  


***Assignment: Your Strengths and Weaknesses***
To complete this lesson, make a copy of this Google Doc, and answer the questions. Then submit this document in the form below, along with an attachment of the screenshot from your 16 personalities test results.

﻿For the first three questions, you may find it helpful to refer back to the list of soft skills that you made earlier in the lesson. 


# To-Do:How to Use Google Calendar to Get (And Stay) Organized and Effective!

The first and most important step of managing your Google Calendar is this: just use it. Constantly adding meetings and time blocks to your calendar can feel like a waste of time--after all, most of us tend to rely on our own memories. But we’re all humans, and humans forget things sometimes. We miss deadlines, we forget about important tasks, we mix up time zones and accidentally show up at meetings an hour early (or worse: an hour late). 

Managing a Google Calendar can take 10 minutes out of your day, yes--time that you may want to spend coding or relaxing or just grabbing a cup of coffee. It can be boring and repetitive but like many boring, repetitive tasks, it is absolutely necessary. Those 10 minutes of organization can be the difference between you missing an interview or not, or between meeting a work deadline and forgetting it. Get in the habit right now of using your Google Calendar, and continue using it.

Using it is necessary. But there are tips and tricks you can take advantage of that will make using your Google Calendar organization simpler and even more useful. We’ll start with basic organizational strategies, and then discuss some of the cool features Google Calendar offers--features that will hopefully allow you to take control of your schedules, rather than having your schedules control you!

***Before You Begin***
Before you start diving into tips and tricks, make sure that you fully understand how to use Google Calendar’s core features: scheduling, creating calendars, setting events to repeat, etc. This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EjJ55BODn0 offers a clear, thorough tutorial on these primary features. If you already feel very confident in your knowledge of Google Calendar, feel free to skip it, but if you would like a refresher (or if you’re not 100% sure how to manage your calendar), we strongly recommend it.

***Time Blocking: How to Use Google Calendar to Enforce Our Favorite Time Management Strategy***

If you’ve ever struggled with time management and done some research online, you may have heard of time blocking. Time blocking is a simple strategy: rather than creating “to-do” lists and checking things off, you’ll instead “block” off specific timeframes on your calendar for specific tasks. Then you stick to those time blocks, even if it means having to pause a task before you’re done in order to move on to the next event.

Microverse already encourages the use of time blocking: you can find your suggested schedule on the student dashboard, and the peer-programming aspect of Microverse helps all students stick to that schedule. As interview prep students and job searchers (and later on as full-time developers), however, you will have to independently structure your own day, and time-blocking offers a huge advantage; in the article linked above, one author actually estimated that time-blocking increased his productivity by 50%.


Here’s an example of what a job searching student’s Google Calendar might look like: <img>

The key to time blocking is sticking to it. In the example above, a student might dedicate the first hour of their day to “catching up--” answering emails, responding to interview requests, completing a few tasks they didn’t get the chance to finish yesterday. However, as soon as the clock hits 9 o’clock, it’s time to search for job applications, even if they didn’t finish catching up on emails or messages. That student might then spend an hour bookmarking job postings. Then, as soon as it’s 10 o’clock, the student will stop searching, and start working on their applications.


Time blocking keeps one task from taking up your entire day and preventing you from working on other, equally important tasks. It also, however, allows for flexibility.


***Google Calendar lets you schedule multiple events in the same time period. That means you can be flexible.***

Most of us follow a pretty similar schedule on a day to day basis. Most of us also know, though, that exceptions occur. Sometimes we have doctor’s appointments. Sometimes our whole town suffers a power failure. And sometimes we schedule interviews!

Luckily, Google Calendar knows this, and it allows you to “double-book” time slots--that way, you can add one-time-only events without having to re-do your entire schedule.

Let’s use the example above of a job searching student. This job searching student normally spends two hours between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM working on coding and project improvements. However, today, the student has a one-hour interview scheduled at 2:00 PM! Instead of deleting their normal “Coding/Project Improvement” event, the student can instead schedule a new event on top of it! Their updated schedule will look like this:


***Google Calendar also lets you create multiple calendars***

Double-booking can be very useful, and there’s nothing wrong with managing your calendar in this way. If you want to get even more organized, however, Google Calendar also offers you the ability to create multiple calendars. In other words, you can have a calendar for daily tasks, another calendar specifically to manage interviews, a third calendar to manage appointments and errands--if multiple calendars would make your organization simpler for you, Google offers that ability! Learn how to use Google Calendars with the video below:

That’s a basic overview of how to use time blocking and Google Calendar’s flexible “double-booking” and multi-calendar features. However, those are just the basics. Now let’s discuss tips and tricks to make your Calendar work for you.

***Add a Secondary Time Zone***

As remote students (and potentially as future developers part of remote teams), you’ll probably be meeting with people from multiple time zones. The last thing you want to do is miss a meeting because you did the time conversion incorrectly. Google Calendar allows you to add a second time zone to your calendar--that way, you’ll never be confused by time zones again.

Watch the video below to learn how to do so!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q72abY_5D0&feature=emb_logo


***Add a World Clock to Check Multiple Time Zones***

Google Calendar lets you add a second time zone, but if you constantly find yourself Googling “What time is it in [City],” you’ll probably need something more. In that case, you can add a World Clock to your Calendar! This is one of the neatest tricks that Google Calendar offers. You’ll find a very thorough, easy-to-follow guide here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ico2Pnbk0bw&feature=emb_logo


***Share Your Calendar***

There are many free scheduling tools out there that will allow coworkers and friends to drop meetings onto your schedule. One of the easiest ways to do this, though, is just by sharing your calendar with them. Sharing your calendar will allow other people to avoid scheduling conflicts when adding or suggesting meeting times, and is pretty simple to do. Here’s a very detailed tutorial: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6rG0CyLeFc&feature=emb_logo


***Transform Scheduling Emails Into Calendar Events***

Going back and forth between your email and your calendar can be frustrating and time-consuming. Thankfully, Google offers the ability to turn your emails into calendar events with the click of a button. You may still need to edit some of the event information, such as the date/time, but this feature can be incredibly helpful, and can simplify your organization processes immensely.

***Get Emails With Your Daily Agendas***

Google Calendar includes the ability to automatically receive a daily email containing your agenda, and unless you’re the sort of person who constantly checks their calendar, this can be incredibly useful for you--especially if some of the events on your calendar are in-person. Watch the video below for instructions: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hovfE2I60hM&feature=emb_logo


***Set up Working Hours***

When you’re working in a remote/distributed team, everyone’s going to have slightly different working hours. This is great for flexibility, but it’s less great when a coworker keeps adding 5:00 AM meetings on your calendar. Adding your working hours to your calendar will help prevent this--anytime someone attempts to schedule a meeting outside of those working hours, they’ll be given an alert that lets them know you aren’t working at that time. Need instructions? Find them here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1UJdgMVZYE&feature=emb_logo

And if you want to see how this will look for your coworkers, you can watch the implementation here: 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui9iKmFfij4&feature=emb_logo


***Notifications***

We all lose track of time sometimes, even when we’re actively trying to be organized. Luckily, Google Calendar allows you to modify event notifications, giving you the option to receive either emails or popups to let you know 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or even hours or days before an event is scheduled to occur. Not sure how? Here’s a video with detailed instructions: 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asxtTNlMNqE&feature=emb_logo


***Automatically add Zoom links to your Google Calendar***

If you’ve ever stared at a calendar event and had no idea where you all were actually meeting, don’t worry! The Zoom add-on is here to prevent that from ever happening again. Google Calendar allows you to add a Zoom integration to your calendar and then create a video conferencing link each time you schedule a new meeting. Watch the video below for a short how-to:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhculbcktuw&feature=emb_logo


***Add Google Hangouts***

Zoom is one of the most widely-used video conferencing apps in existence, but some people you speak to may not have it downloaded. In that case, Google Hangouts can be a great second-choice! This process is even easier than Zoom’s. Check out instructions here:

# To-Do:Setting Goals

***Why do we set goals?***

Goals help us get work done more efficiently and productively. When you start your day you will be much more effective, productive, and motivated when you have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish.



A second purpose of goals is to turn big tasks into smaller, more attainable goals.

The goal of "Finishing Microverse" can seem much more overwhelming compared to "finishing the first HTML part of the curriculum."



Bigger, long term goals, can seem harder and more overwhelming that smaller short term goals. That is why we ask you to make your goals as small as possible.



So if your goal from your Weekly Retrospective is to "Getting started the React Curriculum". You should use your daily goals to break this into smaller tasks and define what you want to achieve per day. So your goal for Monday can be getting through "Basic Data types" part of the curriculum and your goal for Tuesday can be getting through the "Variables" part of the curriculum



Setting goals requires you to plan your days and weeks ahead. So you should always take a moment to look at the materials that is expected from you so that you know what is ahead of you and you and you can plan your days.



How do I decide what goals I want to set?

When you start a new part of the curriculum, a project, a professional skill or any other tasks, take the time to take have an overview at what you are trying to achieve, so that you can decide on the steps you need to take and plan these steps over a certain time frame.

Each week you should have an idea of the specific task that you are trying to achieve. Those tasks should be split into daily steps, which will be your daily goals.



So how do I set goals?

SMART Goals.

SMART method will help you write your goals in a way that you will be more likely to achieve that goal. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely. 



While all aspects of SMART goals are equally important, right now we will only start with the first three aspects and you will learn about the other two later. Today we will look at the "S", "A" and "T". 



S: Specific. Your goal should be specific enough so you know exactly what you want to achieve. 



Examples:

Not specific: I will start the React Calculator project.

Specific: I will finish milestone one of the React Calculator project.



Not Specific: I will practice English.

Specific: I will do three Duolingo exercises to practice my English skills. 



Not Specific: Do Professional skills

Specific: I will complete the "Writing a professional Resume and LinkedIn" for review.



Not specific: I will be more motivated this week.

Specific: I will write down three reasons why I want to be a software developer before I start my day to increase my level of motivation. 



A: Attainable. Your goals should be attainable and realistic. We often over estimate what we will be able to achieve in the coming weeks and how much time we will have to work on the curriculum, so this step is important to reflect on that. Some days we might need to spend more than 8 hours on a project, as we weren't able to finish in time. In that case, we should include a short plan of how to deal with other responsibilities as this helps us think about if what we want to achieve is really possible.



Examples:

Not achievable: I will study 15 hours per day from now going forward!

Achievable: I will study 3 hours longer per day as I did not finish as planned. I will communicate with my family members or other people at my house to complete house responsibilities at a later time.



Not achievable: I will become good at English.

Achievable: I will try to improve my English by practicing 15 minutes on Duolingo per day.



Not achievable: I will work 12 hours straight on the Capstone project and finish the project early.

Achievable: I will plan to work 7 hours on the Capstone project on Monday take breaks to make sure my brain is working properly to finish such a difficult project.



T: Timely. A goal should always include a time because this will give you more structure. Adding a time brings clarity on when you should achieve what. You will know clearly when to start and when to finish.



Examples: 

Not timely: I will work on Capstone Project this week.

Timely: I will start the Capstone project on Monday and finish it by Wednesday.



Not timely: I will finish the LinkedIn Professional skills project.

Timely: I will spend three hours on the LinkedIn Professional skills project tomorrow.



Not timely: I will read the React Curriculum.

Timely: I will take three days to go through the React Curriculum.



Now what does it look like when all three aspects of the SAR method are included in one goal? Please see three examples below:

Goal 1: This week I will spend 15 minutes per day practicing English on Duolingo. 

Goal 2: This week I will complete Writing a professional Resume and LinkedIn for review by Tuesday evening. 

Goal 3: This week I will start the React Calculator project by Monday and I will finish milestone one by the end of the day.
