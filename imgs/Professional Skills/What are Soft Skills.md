# To-Do:Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice (Project: Soft Skills Assessment)

***Why Soft Skills Matter***
As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.

In general, soft skills are attitudes and habits that shape how you work, alone and on teams. Soft skills help you develop strong relationships with coworkers and contribute to a positive work culture. Examples of soft skills valued by employers:

* Teamwork
* Integrity
* Good communication skills
* Reliability
* Organization


At Microverse, we are working every day to build an excellent technical learning experience, but coding languages are not enough; we want you to finish Microverse with excellent soft skills as well. 


***Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice***
As you work through the Professional Skills Curriculum lessons, remember that soft skills get better with awareness and practice. No matter what stage of our career, we all have areas we can improve on. Perhaps you are a good communicator, but struggle with time management. Maybe you are the most punctual person ever, but have a hard time speaking your opinions. With each lesson in the Professional Skills Curriculum, we will help you learn about your strengths and areas of weakness and give you lots of chances to practice and improve.

Task #1: Soft Skills Reading
To begin thinking about where you are strongest and where you can improve your soft skills, read the following articles:

* The Skill You Probably Need to Brush up on for your Engineering Career 
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/engineering-soft-skills-teamwork-collaboration

* How to Develop and Train for Soft Skills in the Workplace (you can also listen to this article read out loud as you read - great for working on English at the same time!): 
https://elearningindustry.com/soft-skills-in-the-workplace-develop-train


Task #2: Reflection
Now, thinking about what you just read, spend 3-5 minutes reflecting on your own soft skills: 

* What are your strongest soft skills? 
* Where do you think you need to improve your soft skills? 
* What is most difficult for you when working with others in class or at work?

Jot your ideas down somewhere; you will use them for the assignment at the end of this lesson.


***What are your strengths and weaknesses?***

An important step to begin improving soft skills is to be comfortable looking at our own strengths and weaknesses. Self awareness and understanding are essential for learning to work better with others. As an exercise in understanding yourself better, please complete The 16 Personalities Test:
