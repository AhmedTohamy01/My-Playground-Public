***Why Soft Skills Matter***
As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.
