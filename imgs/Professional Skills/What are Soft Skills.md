# To-Do:Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice (Project: Soft Skills Assessment)

***Why Soft Skills Matter***
As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.

In general, soft skills are attitudes and habits that shape how you work, alone and on teams. Soft skills help you develop strong relationships with coworkers and contribute to a positive work culture. Examples of soft skills valued by employers:

* Teamwork
* Integrity
* Good communication skills
* Reliability
* Organization


At Microverse, we are working every day to build an excellent technical learning experience, but coding languages are not enough; we want you to finish Microverse with excellent soft skills as well. 


***Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice***
As you work through the Professional Skills Curriculum lessons, remember that soft skills get better with awareness and practice. No matter what stage of our career, we all have areas we can improve on. Perhaps you are a good communicator, but struggle with time management. Maybe you are the most punctual person ever, but have a hard time speaking your opinions. With each lesson in the Professional Skills Curriculum, we will help you learn about your strengths and areas of weakness and give you lots of chances to practice and improve.

Task #1: Soft Skills Reading
To begin thinking about where you are strongest and where you can improve your soft skills, read the following articles:

* The Skill You Probably Need to Brush up on for your Engineering Career 
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/engineering-soft-skills-teamwork-collaboration

* How to Develop and Train for Soft Skills in the Workplace (you can also listen to this article read out loud as you read - great for working on English at the same time!): 
https://elearningindustry.com/soft-skills-in-the-workplace-develop-train


Task #2: Reflection
Now, thinking about what you just read, spend 3-5 minutes reflecting on your own soft skills: 

* What are your strongest soft skills? 
* Where do you think you need to improve your soft skills? 
* What is most difficult for you when working with others in class or at work?

Jot your ideas down somewhere; you will use them for the assignment at the end of this lesson.


***What are your strengths and weaknesses?***

An important step to begin improving soft skills is to be comfortable looking at our own strengths and weaknesses. Self awareness and understanding are essential for learning to work better with others. As an exercise in understanding yourself better, please complete The 16 Personalities Test: 

  

* Link to the 16 Personalities Test
https://www.16personalities.com/

* Expect to spend about 10 minutes answering the questions
* If English is your second language, we suggest having a page open to a dictionary or translation page in  case there are words you don't know.
* When you are finished:
  - Please take a screenshot of the results page showing what type of personality you are or email yourself the results
  - Follow the "Start Reading" link
  - Look at the "Explore Your Type" menu on the left of the page and find "Strengths and Weaknesses"
  - Read about the strengths and weaknesses of your personality type  


***Assignment: Your Strengths and Weaknesses***
To complete this lesson, make a copy of this Google Doc, and answer the questions. Then submit this document in the form below, along with an attachment of the screenshot from your 16 personalities test results.

﻿For the first three questions, you may find it helpful to refer back to the list of soft skills that you made earlier in the lesson. 


# To-Do:How to Use Google Calendar to Get (And Stay) Organized and Effective!

The first and most important step of managing your Google Calendar is this: just use it. Constantly adding meetings and time blocks to your calendar can feel like a waste of time--after all, most of us tend to rely on our own memories. But we’re all humans, and humans forget things sometimes. We miss deadlines, we forget about important tasks, we mix up time zones and accidentally show up at meetings an hour early (or worse: an hour late). 

Managing a Google Calendar can take 10 minutes out of your day, yes--time that you may want to spend coding or relaxing or just grabbing a cup of coffee. It can be boring and repetitive but like many boring, repetitive tasks, it is absolutely necessary. Those 10 minutes of organization can be the difference between you missing an interview or not, or between meeting a work deadline and forgetting it. Get in the habit right now of using your Google Calendar, and continue using it.

Using it is necessary. But there are tips and tricks you can take advantage of that will make using your Google Calendar organization simpler and even more useful. We’ll start with basic organizational strategies, and then discuss some of the cool features Google Calendar offers--features that will hopefully allow you to take control of your schedules, rather than having your schedules control you!

***Before You Begin***
Before you start diving into tips and tricks, make sure that you fully understand how to use Google Calendar’s core features: scheduling, creating calendars, setting events to repeat, etc. This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EjJ55BODn0 offers a clear, thorough tutorial on these primary features. If you already feel very confident in your knowledge of Google Calendar, feel free to skip it, but if you would like a refresher (or if you’re not 100% sure how to manage your calendar), we strongly recommend it.

***Time Blocking: How to Use Google Calendar to Enforce Our Favorite Time Management Strategy***

If you’ve ever struggled with time management and done some research online, you may have heard of time blocking. Time blocking is a simple strategy: rather than creating “to-do” lists and checking things off, you’ll instead “block” off specific timeframes on your calendar for specific tasks. Then you stick to those time blocks, even if it means having to pause a task before you’re done in order to move on to the next event.

Microverse already encourages the use of time blocking: you can find your suggested schedule on the student dashboard, and the peer-programming aspect of Microverse helps all students stick to that schedule. As interview prep students and job searchers (and later on as full-time developers), however, you will have to independently structure your own day, and time-blocking offers a huge advantage; in the article linked above, one author actually estimated that time-blocking increased his productivity by 50%.


Here’s an example of what a job searching student’s Google Calendar might look like: <img>

The key to time blocking is sticking to it. In the example above, a student might dedicate the first hour of their day to “catching up--” answering emails, responding to interview requests, completing a few tasks they didn’t get the chance to finish yesterday. However, as soon as the clock hits 9 o’clock, it’s time to search for job applications, even if they didn’t finish catching up on emails or messages. That student might then spend an hour bookmarking job postings. Then, as soon as it’s 10 o’clock, the student will stop searching, and start working on their applications.


Time blocking keeps one task from taking up your entire day and preventing you from working on other, equally important tasks. It also, however, allows for flexibility.


***Google Calendar lets you schedule multiple events in the same time period. That means you can be flexible.***

Most of us follow a pretty similar schedule on a day to day basis. Most of us also know, though, that exceptions occur. Sometimes we have doctor’s appointments. Sometimes our whole town suffers a power failure. And sometimes we schedule interviews!

Luckily, Google Calendar knows this, and it allows you to “double-book” time slots--that way, you can add one-time-only events without having to re-do your entire schedule.

Let’s use the example above of a job searching student. This job searching student normally spends two hours between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM working on coding and project improvements. However, today, the student has a one-hour interview scheduled at 2:00 PM! Instead of deleting their normal “Coding/Project Improvement” event, the student can instead schedule a new event on top of it! Their updated schedule will look like this:


***Google Calendar also lets you create multiple calendars***

Double-booking can be very useful, and there’s nothing wrong with managing your calendar in this way. If you want to get even more organized, however, Google Calendar also offers you the ability to create multiple calendars. In other words, you can have a calendar for daily tasks, another calendar specifically to manage interviews, a third calendar to manage appointments and errands--if multiple calendars would make your organization simpler for you, Google offers that ability! Learn how to use Google Calendars with the video below:

That’s a basic overview of how to use time blocking and Google Calendar’s flexible “double-booking” and multi-calendar features. However, those are just the basics. Now let’s discuss tips and tricks to make your Calendar work for you.

***Add a Secondary Time Zone***

As remote students (and potentially as future developers part of remote teams), you’ll probably be meeting with people from multiple time zones. The last thing you want to do is miss a meeting because you did the time conversion incorrectly. Google Calendar allows you to add a second time zone to your calendar--that way, you’ll never be confused by time zones again.

Watch the video below to learn how to do so!
