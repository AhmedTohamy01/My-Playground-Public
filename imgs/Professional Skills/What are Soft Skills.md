# To-Do:Improving Soft Skills Takes Practice (Project: Soft Skills Assessment)

***Why Soft Skills Matter***
As a Microverse student, you are working hard every day to learn the skills you will use as a software developer. But coding skills—the hard skills of software development—are not enough for succeeding in your career. You will also need to be able to show you are reliable, collaborate well on teams, and more. These “soft skills” are essential for success—so essential, that some people like to say that hard skills can get you the job, but it's soft skills that allow you to keep it and thrive.

In general, soft skills are attitudes and habits that shape how you work, alone and on teams. Soft skills help you develop strong relationships with coworkers and contribute to a positive work culture. Examples of soft skills valued by employers:

* Teamwork
* Integrity
* Good communication skills
* Reliability
* Organization


At Microverse, we are working every day to build an excellent technical learning experience, but coding languages are not enough; we want you to finish Microverse with excellent soft skills as well.
