***To-Do:What Makes a Great GitHub Profile? (Project: Your GitHub Profile)***

Note: this is an application-based project. Once you reach JavaScript, a career coach will review this project and offer feedback and/or suggestions for improvement.

You've probably used GitHub extensively by this point, and have already read Microverse's lesson on maintaining professionalism in GitHub. Please take some time to re-read that lesson, and to come back to it regularly each time you add a project to GitHub and create a README.

While your GitHub profile should already have descriptive commits and solid README files, creating a profile strong enough to catch and maintain the interest of recruiters or hiring managers takes a little more work.
