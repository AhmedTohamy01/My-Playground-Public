***To-Do:What Makes a Great GitHub Profile? (Project: Your GitHub Profile)***

Note: this is an application-based project. Once you reach JavaScript, a career coach will review this project and offer feedback and/or suggestions for improvement.

You've probably used GitHub extensively by this point, and have already read Microverse's lesson on maintaining professionalism in GitHub. Please take some time to re-read that lesson, and to come back to it regularly each time you add a project to GitHub and create a README.

While your GitHub profile should already have descriptive commits and solid README files, creating a profile strong enough to catch and maintain the interest of recruiters or hiring managers takes a little more work.

*Why is a Strong GitHub Profile So Important?*

Your GitHub profile is like your resume in the software world; it gives hiring managers insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do. You can tell a company that you have skills in React, but if they look at your GitHub and see no React projects, they're not going to believe you. Likewise, you can tell a company that you have good documentation skills,  but if they take a look at your README files and they're messy, disorganized, or incomplete, they're not going to give you a chance to prove them wrong.

In other words, it's vitally important that you put just as much of an effort into creating a strong GitHub profile as you do into creating strong projects or strong resumes. The first step is making sure that you complete all sections. 

There are two areas to complete in your profile: the personal profile and the pinned projects. The instructions below will help you fill out each of the following sections on the main section page of your profile:


*Sidebar/Personal Profile*

* Fill out all sections: your name, email, bio, portfolio, location and company. 
  - Name: Fill out your first and last name. If you have privacy concerns, you can also use your first and last initial.
  - Company: In the "company" section, you may write Freelance Full-stack Developer
  - Location: List your country. You do not need to give detailed location information, such as city or state, unless you want to.
  - Bio: Your bio field should be 2-3 sentences of jam-packed information. Include your preferred stack, how many years of experience you have (if more than 1), and state that you're currently looking for new opportunities.
  - Email: Fill in your email address; it will not be visible to those without accounts.
  - Portfolio: If you have a portfolio, list it here. You may not have created a portfolio yet, in which case you might not have a link to add to the URL field. For now, you can leave it blank, or insert your LinkedIn URL instead. However, once you create your portfolio, go back to your GitHub and add the URL.

* Add a professional profile photo.
  - If you don't have a professional photo yet, don't worry—you'll be taking one later on in the Professional Skills curriculum. For now, use a photo that looks friendly, and replace it with a professional photo as soon as you complete the Photo task.
  - Remember that your photo is probably going to be one of the first impressions a hiring manager has of you: even if you plan on replacing your photo later, choose a photo that looks tidy, high-quality, and nice.

* Include private contributions in your profile.
  - In "Contributions," check the box in order to include your private contributions in the profile.
  - Note that this will not make your private projects public. It will merely show that you were coding on a private project that day and help keep your profile looking active.


* Jobs Profile
  - In the "Jobs Profile" field, check the box to set yourself available for hire.

* Set your status to indicate that you're Available for Hire or Looking for New Opportunities.


*Fill Out a Personal README (optional, but recommended)*

GitHub allows you to create a README file that displays at the top of your GitHub profile above the pinned projects where you can write whatever you want, allowing even more customization of your GitHub profile. This is a fantastic way to promote your work in ways that are more prominent than simply linking to your portfolio or pinning your best projects.

How to create a profile README

Create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username. (Note this is case-sensitive.)
Create a README.md file inside the new repo with your custom content.
Once you commit and push it, it will display on your profile.

You can find a tutorial with some good examples here.

Your personal README should be professional but fun, and should showcase a little bit of your personality along with your knowledge/projects. In general, the best way to use your profile README is to link to projects you've worked on that are not hosted on GitHub, display attractive images/screenshots, and/or display some live updating statistics about your contributions to projects on GitHub.

To see how best to do that, have a look at what other people are doing to decide how best to use your GitHub profile README space. Here are 10 standout GitHub profile READMEs

*Pinned Projects*

https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile

1) Start pinning your most complete/complex repositories to your profile. 
- The goal is to have six repositories pinned, and to showcase a range of technologies in your pinned projects. In other words, your GitHub should eventually have pinned repositories showcasing skills in React, Ruby, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, etc. Unless you have previous developer experience, right now you may only have one or two basic HTML projects. That's fine! However, going forward, start pinning projects that use a range of technologies.
- A note about pinning open source projects you contributed to: The pinning feature will also let you pin projects that you contributed to but do not own. You should use this feature if you have made a significant contribution to a notable project, but be careful not to mislead people into into thinking you're a major contributor to significant open source project unless you actually are.
- Examples of open source contributions to pin or not to pin: if you implemented a significant feature in a popular JS framework; especially if you've gotten multiple separate commits into the project, go ahead and list it. However if your contribution was relatively minor (e.g. fixing a minor bug in React or adding some documentation), then you probably shouldn't pin that project because it might mislead employers into thinking you're a core contributor to the project.
- If your open source contribution was too minor to pin: Unfortunately GitHub does not have an easy way to let you brag about making small but noteworthy contributions to major projects via the pinning system, so in lieu of that we recommend instead that you brag about those kinds of contributions on your resume, LinkedIn, AngelList, portfolio and other places where you can describe what your contributions were to these major projects in greater detail with more context.

2) Star your friends’ and mentor’s profile and repositories and ask them to star yours.

3) OPTIONAL: Change what languages display on your GitHub projects.


Congratulations! Your profile/overview is now done!


*A Note on README Files*

Your README files are one of the most important sections of your GitHub portfolio: a good README file will not only show off your projects, but they'll also highlight your documentation skills, your attention to detail, your ability to explain complicated concepts in simple ways, and your willingness to constantly improve. In other words, it's important to put a lot of care and thought into how you create them. Basically: if you're writing a README file in 10 minutes, your README file is probably way too short. 

Starting August 2020, career coaches will no longer be manually reviewing pinned READMEs. However, you should still put the maximum effort possible into writing a good README. Remember:

* Hiring managers read README files; write them as if your future manager is going to be grading you on them. If you really want to impress, then you can also include mockups, diagrams, or even wiki pages or separate Markdown files to describe more difficult projects.

* Don't save README files for later! If there's anything worse than having to write one README, it's having to write five of them at once.

* And while you're on GitHub, please review all your stale Pull Requests and Issues and decide whether to close them or proceed to merge/apply.
